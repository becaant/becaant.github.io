        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm a motivated Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering student at Queen's University passionate about systems engineering, mobile robotics, and research. Ultimately, I want to work in a world where robots can go places we can't conceive of yet, performing useful tasks we can't conceive yet. I'm impact-driven, value feedback, and love to learn.
            <br><br>
            I find my interests focus on the system design and control of wheeled mobile robots. In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to conduct a research project on the automation of motor graders at Ingenuity Labs with MacLean Engineering, with work to be featured on their GR5 and GR8 models. Before that, I led the 90-person Queen's AutoDrive Team to its strongest performance to date. Over the course of a year, we successfully drove autonomously around MCity, earning 3rd place in the Intersection Challenge.
            <br><br>
            I am currently looking for Master's (MASc) placements in Canada and the US. My research interests include the systems engineering of mobile robotic systems, with a particular interest in the control/localization/planning of WMRs in complicated environments.
