        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I consider myself a Robotic Systems Engineer, specifically for Wheeled Mobile Robots. I have had the opportunity to design a novel control scheme for overactuated motor graders as part of USRA research at Ingenuity Labs, and the pleasure of designing the system architecture for a real-life autonomous vehicle as part of the GM-SAE AutoDrive Challenge II as Team Captain. Additionally, I implemented a global planner scheme for our car, and fused camera detections with LiDAR data to obtain 3D position of all objects in the FOV. Be it controls, planning, estimation, perception, or integration, I am excited to make it happen.</p>

        <p>I'm always happy to chat with enthusiastic people! Feel free to reach out to talk about robotics, research, or just to chat.</p>
