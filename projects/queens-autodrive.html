        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            It's hard to summarize the profound effect Queen's AutoDrive has had on me as an individual. From data labeller to system integration lead, to technical lead, and finally to team captain, this team has defined my undergraduate career.

        <p>
            In a nutshell, we compete annually as part of the GM-SAE AutoDrive Challenge II international competition to develop an SAE-level 4 autonomous vehicle. Given a Chevrolet Bolt, and top-of-the-line equipment, we are left to our devices to make it happen. Year III was marked with significant adversity - starting from scratch, with an all-new team, and any team's nightmare incident - we came together as a 90-person unit to get our car to drive autonomously when it counted. Ultimately, we were awarded $1,000 for placing 3rd in the Intersection Challenge, I hope the video below conveys our excitement to you!

        <p>
            This project requires expertise from all facets of robotics; perception, control, planning, hardware design, vehicle interfacing, integration, and more.

            </div>

            To ensure the success of such an interconnected project, I conducted three full-day design reviews to put our members on the hot seat, it was here that we all became familiar with each others progress, what worked and what didn't.
