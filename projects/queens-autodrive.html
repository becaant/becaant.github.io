        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            It's hard to summarize the profound effect <a href="https://autodrive.engineering.queensu.ca/" class="home-place">Queen's AutoDrive</a>
            has had on me as an individual. From data labeller to system integration lead, to technical lead, and finally to team captain, this team has defined my undergraduate career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Queen's AutoDrive competes annually as part of the <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/autodrive-challenge-series2" class="home-place">GM-SAE AutoDrive Challenge II</a>
            international competition to develop an SAE-level 4 autonomous vehicle. Given a Chevrolet Bolt, and top-of-the-line equipment, we are left to our devices to make it happen. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7DG-t2aiQ">Year III</a> we had to start from scratch, not a single piece of hardware, line of code, or organizational structure was carried over. In the face of this, and an ... unfortunate integration with a table ... we came together as a 90-person unit to drive autonomously when it counted. Beating teams with three years of development, we were awarded $1,000 for placing 3rd in the Intersection Challenge, I hope the video below conveys our excitement to you!

        <h2>Design & Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            This project requires expertise from all facets of robotics; perception, control, planning, hardware design, vehicle interfacing, integration, and more.

            </div>

            To ensure the success of such an interconnected project, I conducted three full-day design reviews to put our members on the hot seat, it was here that we all became familiar with each others progress, what worked and what didn't. Each of the 45 consistently attending members had to convey what they were working on, their timeline, and what they are stuck on; open to questions.

        <h2>What Did I Work On?</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to Project Management, system design, and administrative duties, I undertook numerous technical projects that were critical to the success of the team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In Year IV my role was split into 5: Team Captain, Project Manager, Operations Manager, Global Planner Team Lead, and Sensor Fusion Team Lead. Currently, I act as a design consultant and a mentor to the team.
