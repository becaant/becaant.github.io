        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Motor graders play in a crucial role in the efficient operation of any mining operation, especially in underground applications. The moldboard (blade) passes over the ground to smooth uneven terrain so other vehicles can operate under nominal conditions.

            However, to position the blade in all orientations required on site, motor graders have highly redundant kinematics for moldboard control, as well as driving. As a result, graders are the last stalwart to full mine automation. Multiple times a day, autonomous mining zones must be shut down so a human operator can grade the path. But with 4 driving inputs (speed, articulation angle, steering angle, wheel pitch), and 5 moldboard inputs, manual grading is often inefficient.

        <p> 
            For this project, under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Marshall @ Offroad Robotics, I derived two path following control schemes for motor graders. I derived the vehicle kinematics and feedback linearization (FBL) for each, and applied FBL+PD, FBL+MPC, and NMPC path following control, simulated with Python.

            Both control schemes were effective, above is a demonstration of the FBL+MPC implementation. This work was presented to MacLean Engineering's Advanced Vehicles team, concepts are likely to be included in future grader autonomy efforts.

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            There are two open areas for the path following control. First, the fidelity of the model can be increased to incorporate dynamics, ground-tire interaction, etc. Second, ongoing work to analytically determine the effect of tuning FBL systems applied to nonlinear control.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            This project opened my eyes to what it means to be a researcher. It has driven me down the course of controls and state estimation as a future research direction, and most importantly, has shown me my capacity to learn. I owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. Marshall, Offroad Robotics, and the Ingenuity Labs Research Institute for the opportunity and the environment to grow as much as I did over the summer term.
