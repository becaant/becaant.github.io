        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            
            Iâ€™m a Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering student at Queen's University with a focus on systems engineering, mobile robotics, and research. My goal is to advance robotic systems to operate effectively in complex environments, taking on tasks beyond current capabilities. I aim to deliver measurable results, appreciate the value of iterative feedback, and continuously seek opportunities to learn and improve.
            <br><br>
            As a Robotic Systems Engineer specializing in Wheeled Mobile Robots and as a recipient of the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA), I developed a novel path-following control scheme for motor graders during my research at Ingenuity Labs. As Team Captain of Queen's AutoDrive, I led the design of the system architecture for an autonomous vehicle ðŸš—. Additionally, I implemented a global planner and integrated camera detections with LiDAR data to accurately determine the 3D positions of detected objects in view. Whether itâ€™s controls, planning, estimation, perception, or integration, I am motivated to tackle challenging problems and deliver practical solutions.
            <br><br>
            I am currently seeking Masterâ€™s (MASc) opportunities in Canada and the US. My research interests include the systems engineering of mobile robotic systems, particularly in control, localization, and planning for WMRs in challenging environments. ðŸ’¡
